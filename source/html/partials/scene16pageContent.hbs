                <p>Marble Arch stood as a formal gateway to Buckingham Palace for seventeen years, but it was overshadowed by Bloreâ€™s enlarged Buckingham Palace and seen as unsatisfactory.</p>
                <p>In 1850 the decision was taken to move the Arch to its current location of Cumberland Gate where it would form a grand entrance to Hyde Park in time for the Great Exhibition of 1851.</p>
                <p>The stone by stone removal and reconstruction of the Arch was overseen by architect Thomas Cubitt who completed the entire complex process in just three months.</p>
