                <p>By 1830 most of the statues and panels were complete and Nash’s work at Buckingham Palace and on the Arch was progressing. And then the King died.</p>
                <p>Shortly after the King’s death Nash was sacked by the Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, for overspending on the project. The architect Edward Blore was commissioned to complete the works in a more economic and practical fashion.<p>
                <p>Finding himself in possession of a jumbled collection of statues and panels, Blore tried to get Nash to provide drawings to explain how the jigsaw was intended to fit together but Nash, unhappy about his dismissal, would not cooperate.</p>
                <p>All Blore really had to go on was Nash’s model and the assortment of sculptures in his yard.</p>
