                <p>Blore incorporated most of the battle scene friezes high up in the central courtyard of Buckingham Palace. In 1835 the rest of the sculptures were given to William Wilkins to use in the construction of the new National Gallery.<p>
                <p>Wilkins did manage to use some of the statues but wanted less military symbolism so he adapted many of them. Figures representing Asia, seated on a camel, and Europe sat upon a horse with an empty frame between them can still be seen above the main door of the gallery.</p>
